This program takes my Homework 10 project and adds the use of the arduino board. The button on the board moves the big red sphere along the z axis and the potentiometer will move the sphere along the x axis. Thes sphere is very jumpy in the video due to the placement of the potentiometer on my bread board, it was difficult to move it steadily with the wires in the way.
